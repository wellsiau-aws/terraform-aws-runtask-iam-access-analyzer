# terraform-runtask-iam-access-analyzer

This module can be used to integrate Terraform Cloud Run Tasks with AWS IAM Access Analyzer for policy validation.

## Usage 

You must complete the [general prerequisites](../README.md#Prerequisites) as referenced in the solution README before deploying this module. 

* Build and package the Lambda files

  ```
  make all
  ```

* Change the TFC org name in the file [`provider.tf`](provider.tf#L5) to your TFC org.

  ```
  terraform {

    cloud {
      # TODO: Change this to your Terraform Cloud org name.
      organization = "<enter your org name here>"
      workspaces {
        tags = ["app:aws-event-bridge"]
      }
    }
    ...
  }   
  ```

* Populate the required variables, change the placeholder value below.
  ```bash
  echo 'tfc_org="<enter your org name here>"' >> tf.auto.tfvars
  echo 'aws_region="<enter the AWS region here>"' >> tf.auto.tfvars
  ```

* Initialize Terraform Cloud. When prompted, enter the name of the new workspace, i.e. `aws-iam_access-analyzer-run-task`
  ```bash
  terraform init
  ```

* Configure the AWS credentials (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) in Terraform Cloud, i.e. using environment variable.

* In order to create and configure the run tasks, you also need to have Terraform Cloud keys stored as Variable/Variable Sets in the workspace. Add `TFE_HOSTNAME` and `TFE_TOKEN` environment variable to the same variable set or directly on the workspace.
![TFC Configure Variable Set](../diagram/TerraformCloud-VariableSets.png?raw=true "Configure Terraform Cloud Variable Set")

* Run Terraform apply
  ```bash
  terraform apply
  ```

* Navigate to your Terraform Cloud organization, go to Organization Settings > Integrations > Run tasks to find the newly created Run Task `aws-ia2-runtask`. 

You can use this run task in any workspace where you have standard IAM resource policy document. Use the example steps below to continue with the demonstration.
